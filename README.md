A class is a fundamental building block in object-oriented programming that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (also known as attributes or fields) and behaviors (methods or functions) that objects of that class will have. A class itself does not store any data for a specific instance; instead, it provides a general structure that multiple objects can follow. It serves as an abstract representation of an entity, outlining what attributes it should have and what actions it can perform.

An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a tangible entity that is created based on the class definition, with its own unique values for the attributes defined in the class. When an object is instantiated, memory is allocated to store its specific data. Each object operates independently, meaning changes to one object do not affect others, even if they originate from the same class. Objects allow for interaction within a program by utilizing the methods defined in their class to perform actions and manipulate data.

The primary conceptual difference between classes and objects is that a class is an abstract template, while an object is a concrete realization of that template. A class merely defines what an object should be capable of, but an object is the actual entity that exists and operates in a program. A useful analogy is comparing a class to a blueprint for a house and an object to an actual house built from that blueprint. The blueprint provides a standardized design, but the actual house is a unique instance that follows the specifications. In programming, this distinction allows for the efficient reuse of code, promoting modularity and maintainability in software development.
