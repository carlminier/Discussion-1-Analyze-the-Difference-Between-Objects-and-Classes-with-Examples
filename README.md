A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. It serves as a foundational structure that allows the creation of multiple instances with shared characteristics but independent data. A class itself does not hold any actual data; rather, it outlines how data should be structured and manipulated.

An object is an instance of a class. When a class is used to create an object, memory is allocated, and the object is initialized with its own set of data that follows the structure defined by the class. Objects embody the actual implementation of the classes blueprint, holding real values and enabling interactions through defined behaviors.

The main difference between classes and objects is that a class is an abstract definition, whereas an object is a concrete manifestation of that definition. A class describes what an object should be, but an object is an actual entity that exists in memory and can be used in a program. A useful analogy is to think of a class as a recipe and an object as the prepared dishâ€”the recipe outlines the steps and ingredients, but the dish is the tangible result.
